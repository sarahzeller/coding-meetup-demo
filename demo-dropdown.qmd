## Tabsets driven by a `select`

This filter adds a tabset which can be controlled via a `select` element ðŸ˜Ž.

## The traditional way
That's how regular tabset look like:

::: {.panel-tabset}
### Dresden

Tab content on Dresden.

### Berlin

Berlin has a tab pane as well.

:::

## Now â€“ the same, but controlled by a `select` ðŸ¤™

Using the `quarto-select-tabset` [filter](https://github.com/jakoblistabarth/quarto-select-tabset) , you can create a tabset that is controlled by a select element. 
The `option-label` attribute is used to set the label of the default option in the select element.


This is how a similar component controlled by a select looks like.

::: {.panel-select option-label="Select a city â€¦"}

### Dresden

Dresden Content. With some paragraphs.

And even a code chunk!

```{r}
#| label: test-chunk
print("test")
```

### Berlin

The second tab pane is all about Berlin.

### Munich

This is the 3rd pane. Munich content goes here.

:::

## One more time â€¦

::: {.panel-select}

### Dresden

A second time a tab pane with the same name to test for possible conflicts.

### Berlin

Berlin a second time to test possible duplicates

### Munich

And once more Munich to test possible duplicates
